## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the project from the GitHub repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:wincentek/softhouse.git
```

Navigate to the `text2xml2text` folder:

```
cd softhouse/text2xml2text
```

### Run the Script

Run the script using the following command:

```
Demo: 
python3 text2xml2text.py --file demo.txt

Use your own file
python3 text2xml2text.py --file your_input_file.txt
```

- Accepts either `.txt` or `.xml` as input.
- Auto-detects input type and converts accordingly.

## üìÑ Input Formats

### Text Format (`.txt`)

Each line starts with a prefix:

- `P|first name|last name` ‚Äì New person
- `T|mobile|landline` ‚Äì Phone
- `A|street|city|zip` ‚Äì Address
- `F|name|born` ‚Äì Family member

### XML Format (`.xml`)

Structured XML using `<person>`, `<phone>`, `<address>`, and `<family>` elements.

## üíæ Output & Saved Files

- Output is printed to the terminal.

Output Files:
- Files are saved in the same folder as the input.
- The converted files, and errors, are saved with a timestamp prefix in the format `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`.
- For example, if the input file is `example.txt`, the converted XML file will be named `20250527_153045_example_converted.xml`.
- Similarly, if the input file is `example.xml`, the converted text file will be named `20250527_153045_example_converted.txt`.
- If error lines were found, they're stored as `20250527_153045_errors_example_converted.txt`.
